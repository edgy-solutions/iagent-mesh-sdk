# Identity is part of the SDK's public surface, not an internal of transport_auth: a tool
# handler annotates a parameter `CallerIdentity` and a helper below it calls `current_caller()`.
# Importing those from a module named `transport_auth` misfiles them as a transport concern —
# they are the answer to "who is asking", which is the whole per-user read path.

# A graph's CONTRACT and the helper that makes it a verb. Public surface, not an internal of a
# host engine: a team running their own host (ADR-0046 §8.5 route C) imports exactly these, so
# "plug into our host" vs "run your own" is a deployment choice rather than a second
# implementation. The same `validate_dir` is what the policy repo's PR gate imports and what
# the seed cronjob runs against the composed result — one validator, two rails.
